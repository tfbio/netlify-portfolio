  I've been studying web development in frontend and backend since 2020 mainly coding
  with both pure javascript and typescript for applications based on React, Next and Node and some Mobile 
  with React Native.
  Possessing an electrical engineering background gave me understanding in Object-oriented programming
  and data structures, also where I developed my analytical thinking and problem solving aptitude. From there
  I've been improving my skills with boot camp trainings and developing my own personal codes.

  My goals for the next years are to progress from Jr.dev to Sr.dev while always improving my soft skills as cooperation
  and communication in team situations, and being able to guide and help other devs to also improve themselves. 
  As for hard skills I aim to dive deeper into React-Node, branch out to other frameworks as Angular, Vue, Java Springboot and
  get a better grasp of database and devOps concepts.
